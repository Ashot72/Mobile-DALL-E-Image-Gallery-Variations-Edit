# Mobile (React Native with Expo) DALL-E Image Gallery with Variations and Edit

This is an extension of my previous DALL-E Image [Gallery app](https://github.com/Ashot72/Mobile-DALL-E-Image-Gallery). 
In the previous app, you can observe how we registered the app, accessed different tenants with multiple users, and built it.
With this app, you can generate various image variations and edit images with your finger to generate multiple images sequentially.

To get started.
```
       Clone the repository

       git clone https://github.com/Ashot72/Mobile-DALL-E-Image-Gallery-Variations-Edit

       # installs dependencies
       npm install
       
       Add a src/secret.ts file based on src/secret.example.ts file and add respective keys.
      
       Generate an Expo development build for development and a preview one for testing purposes.
